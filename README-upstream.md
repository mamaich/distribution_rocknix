---

ROCKNIX is an immutable Linux distribution for handheld gaming devices developed by a small community of enthusiasts.  Our goal is to produce an operating system that has the features and capabilities that we need, and to have fun as we develop it.

## About This Fork

This is an **unofficial** fork of ROCKNIX that provides support for additional devices and emulators not included in the official distribution.

> **Note — device support requests:** Please **do not** open issues asking for support for devices not listed in this README. New device support depends entirely on whether a vendor or community member **donates a development unit**. Maintainers cannot reliably port to hardware they do not have — guessing from specs or marketing photos is not a viable path to a working image.

### Additional Emulators

- **BBK 4980** (gam4980-lr): Electronic dictionary game emulator
- **EKA2L1** (eka2l1-sa): Symbian / N-Gage emulator

- **ppsspp2021-sa**: PPSSPP 2021 standalone (default PSP on RK3326 / RK3566 / RK356X)
- **PyMO/cpymo**: PyMO AVG game engine in C
- **free-j2me**: J2ME SDL2 frontend standalone

#### RK356X Devices (5.10 BSP kernel, three install images)

The **RK356X** platform builds **three install images** — **RK3562**, **RK3566-Generic**, and **RK3566-Specific** — sharing one update package. It uses the **Rockchip 5.10 BSP kernel**, unlike standalone **RK3566** images which use the **mainline 6.x** kernel — do not mix RK356X and RK3566 install packages.

Use `/flash/dtbselect` (Linux) or `DtbselectWin64.exe` (Windows) on the boot partition to pick the device tree for **RK3562** and **RK3566-Specific** targets. **RK3566-Generic** subimage boots via `FDTDIR` (multi-DTB folder) and does not use dtbselect. **Miyoo Flip** and **Radxa ZERO 3W** are supported on standalone **RK3566 Specific** (mainline 6.x) only, not on RK356X.

| Xifan | NGP45H, XF55H | Includes model-specific display, controls, audio, dual TF-card slots, and status/analog-stick LED support. XF55H also includes support for its onboard ZT9101 USB WiFi. Select the exact device entry with `/flash/dtbselect` or `DtbselectWin64.exe`. |

##### RK3566-Generic subimage
| Brand | Models | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Powkiddy | RGB10 Max 3, RGB20 Pro, RGB20 SX, RGB30, RK2023 | Powkiddy handhelds only — **does not include** Anbernic models from standalone **RK3566 Generic**. |

| GameMT | E5P, E6P | |
| MiniLoong | Pocket1 | |
| Powkiddy | X55, X35S, X35H | |

## User manuals

Guides for this fork live in [`documentation/user_man/`](documentation/user_man/) as paired Chinese and English Markdown files (`*_cn.md` / `*_en.md`): general fork usage, drastic_adv `layout.json`, and J2ME controls. PDFs shipped in release images are built in CI from those sources.

## Contributing

Pull requests can request **automatic image builds** in GitHub Actions. Add a `build:` line to the PR description (the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) includes this section by default):

```
build:RK3326/RK3566
```

- **Supported devices:** `RK3326`, `RK3326S`, `RK3566`, `S905`, `RK356X`
- **Multiple devices:** separate with `/`, `,`, `;`, or spaces (e.g. `build:RK3326/RK3566`)
- **All devices:** `build:ALL`
- **Skip builds:** leave `build:` empty or omit the line

CI runs when the PR is opened, updated, or when you edit the description. After a successful build, download `AURKNIX-image-*` and `AURKNIX-update-*` artifacts from the workflow run on the **Checks** tab. PR builds are for testing only and are not published as releases.
